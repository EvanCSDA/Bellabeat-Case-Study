Bellabeat is a wellness company specializing in fitness related devices and web applications. The purpose of this project was to examine trends in a rival companies data to see how its users utilized its devices.

## Business Task
What trends are there in terms of time and activity by users of the FitBit device?

## Data Cleaning Process
Before the files coud be worked with in SQL there was an issue with 14 of the files that needed to be addressed. The date format created a problem for Big Query that kept it from being uploaded. The files were corrected by uploading in Google Sheets, formatting column B as "Date Time" format, and saving as a CSV.

## Summary of Analysis
In summary, the analysis showed that the majority of time (81%) , FitBit users were engaged in sedentary activity. Followed by that was light activity (16%). Very active and fairly active activity were nearly identical at less than 2% of the average daily
time.

## Supporting Visualizations and Key Findings
1. Fitbit users are not weekend warriors. They are workinng people who likely spend many hours sitting in their office chairs.
2. Light activities comprised the majoority of non-sedentary movement and time spent.
